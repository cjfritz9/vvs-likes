                Still waking up alone in a status-driven world? Your like &
                follower count on Instagram serves as your trophy of social
                proof, appeal and online trust. We instinctively rely on others
                for life decisions, from choosing crowded restaurants to
                emulating celebrity fashion. Unfortunately, on Instagram, low
                likes and followers label an account as 'boring.' Yet, there's
                an alternative path. Imagine waking up to thousands of real
                likes and followers every morning, how would your day be
                different?
